## 🤓 Introduction

Pricing is a love-hate topic. Everyone cares about it (users, founders, PMs, sales folks), yet it’s surprisingly under-discussed. There’s no reason for secrecy: we’re not guarding national secrets. Especially in tech, pricing can build trust, signal intent, and help users make faster decisions.

This list brings together great examples, thoughtful articles, and useful research about how to **design and structure software pricing pages** that work. You'll find examples from all kinds of companies: SaaS, infra, productivity tools, AI APIs, and more. 

📌 **Listing rules:**
- Must have at least **one plan with transparent pricing**  
  (*Doesn’t need to be self-serve — but if you say “talk to sales,” at least show the ballpark.*)
- **Contributions welcome!** If you’ve seen a great pricing page (even your own!), feel free to open a PR. Just make sure it fits the spirit of the list.

Think of it as a starting point for:
- PMs and founders launching a new product 💡
- Sales teams figuring out monetization strategy 🧭  
- Designers looking for layout inspiration 🎨
- Growth folks experimenting with plan strategy 📈
- Researchers studying pricing models mechanisms 🧠
